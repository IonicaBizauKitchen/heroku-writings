You are growing more rapidly right now than at any other time in your life. I hear you're the size of a sesame seed, that you already have a heart, and that you have a tail which you will eventually lose. Hopefully.

Z: "Where are the pregnancy tests, my dear?"
J: "In the chicken coop, right at eye level with the toilet"

You're the size of a raspberry now. We like the name Raspberry Taylor, but then people would call you Razz, and the spelling of raspberry is a bit strange.

Soon you'll be the size of an olive.

I knew your mother was pregnant today when she finished her soba noodles and announced that she wanted "one of those croissants with creme brul√©e in the middle": an eclaire.

Saltines and ginger ale in hand, your mother exclaims, "Everything tastes disgusting!".

"I bet Greek women eat so much fucking feta. And they have big ol' babies." - Jenelle, dismissing something she read about stinky cheeses being off-limits to pregnant women.

"Granola is just really not doin' it for me lately" says your mother.

We don't know what size you are, little one. We told your uncle Laird about you today while waiting for the 24th st BART to arrive.

You're the size of a kumquat.

Hi baby. I've not written you in a while. I'm sitting in the living room (or the parlor as we call it), watching your mother read a book called "the wedding", a wedge of cheese on her lap and a knife in her right hand. From time to time she cuts of a small piece and nibbles on it slowly.

Your mama can really feel you now. She rubs her belly regularly. Last night we read that you can sense light.

Today is your grandma Pat's birthday. Yesterday I came back from Hawaii and felt you kick for the first time. You're supposedly the length of a banana. Tomorrow we're going to the hospital for our second ultrasound. I can't wait to see you again. We're not sure whether or not it will be obvious that you're a boy or a girl. We're hoping not to find out tomorrow, but if we do that's okay too.

I haven't written to you much lately, my boy. So much has happened. Your mom says she's keeping notes and we're taking lots of pictures, but I think I'd better start documenting more details of your early life.

This morning _I_ woke _you_ up. That's never happened before. You always wake me up. A few weeks ago, maybe four, you grabbed some avocado from my spoon and put it in your mouth. I don't know if you actually ate any of it, but it was your first known attempt to eat food. The next day you went for my oatmeal. You managed to get some in your mouth, but were surprised at the taste and didn't look too happy about it.
