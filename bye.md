Dear Herokai,

Back in 2007 I moved out to the west coast to live the proverbial California dream. Within a few months of moving to Santa Barbara I found a job working for the infamous Jonathan Siegel at ELC Technologies, a Ruby on Rails consultancy. Having previously worked as a PHP developer, the Ruby programming language and Rails framework were a breath of fresh air. Rails enabled me to build better things in less time, and have more fun doing it. Plus it was a profitable skill to boot.

In those days there was no Heroku (and no GitHub for that matter), and it was incredibly difficult to deploy Rails applications. Unlike PHP, Ruby stuff was not installed or configured on nearly every web server in the world. So even though I could build awesome things on my local machine using Rails, it was hard to get it out there on the web.

When Heroku came along, it gave me a glimmer of hope. It seemed the world of web development was entering a new era where people could easily deploy their applications on the open web without having to think much about the underlying infrastructure. And indeed it was a new era. The companies I worked for in the years that followed didn't really have ops people. We could all be the developers and designers we wanted to be, and rely on Heroku to abstract away the cumbersome aspects of our jobs.

Fast forward to 2012. Having spent a year and change at a Silicon Valley startup spiraling out of control, I decided I would try to get hired at Heroku. I knew I didn't have the technical chops to work on the platform infrastructure, but as a long-time follower of Heroku's every move and a reader of Adam Wiggins' tornado of razorblades blog, I knew that something very special was going on at Heroku, and I wanted to be a part of it.

I came to Heroku to learn from some of the smartest people in our industry, and for the last two years I've done exactly that. For the first half of my tenure here, I worked on the add-ons team to build a new marketplace. My focus was inward: I soaked up as much as I could from my peers. In the latter half of my time at Heroku I turned my focus outward to the thousands of Heroku customers deploying Node apps. In my time here I've learned a ton about programming, design, communicationm, community-building, and relationships in general. Heroku's been a great place to work and I'm happy to have been a part of it.

In a few weeks I'll be moving on to the next thing. As the astute ornithologists among you have noticed, I'm moving to a new house in Oakland this week. My son Cosmos will have his own bedroom, and we'll have a backyard with grass and fruit trees. We'll be near the Montclair neighborhood right next to Joaquin Miller park, a vast and expansive nature area.

I'll also be joining the small team at npm, Inc. My first priorities there will be designing a new website for the burgeoning public npm registry as well as helping build `npme`, a private, on-premise npm registry for enterprise customers. I'm really happy to have found this job, and it feels like a natural step forward for me.

I look forward to the future of the Internet and Heroku's part in it, and will remain a devout customer for the foreseeable future. I also plan to continue to spread the 12-factor gospel in my future endeavors, and will keep my mind open to possibility of eventual npm+Heroku partnerships.

Thanks to all of you for being awesome. I'd like to thank the vibe team especially for making our work environment so comfortable. You will be missed.

My last day at Heroku will be Friday, August 8th. I'll be around the office until then, so feel free to heckle me about Javascript's lack of support for big numbers, or whatever.

Please keep in touch! Check out my redesigned website at zeke.sikelianos.com and if you make it all the way to the bottom of the page there's a form where you can subscribe to my imaginary email newsletter. If I get enough subscribers it will cease to be imaginary.
