There are no facts. Only interpretations. - Nietzsche

As a product designer, I want to build, deploy, monetize, and distribute products with ease. Today Heroku takes me halfway there: I can build great apps and deploy them, but when it comes to monetizing and distributing my work, I'm on my own.

The Heroku Addons program is a great first implementation of this concept, but it's largely focused on Infrastructure as a Service providers. I want to extend the offering of branding and distribution not just to Addons but to every app running on Heroku.

How can we create a workflow that gives app developers the power to brand their apps while maintaining the hacker DX that Heroku is known for? I think the answer is fewer web UIs, and more interfaces that give users flexibility and the freedom to use whatever tools fit their workflow. Furthermore, every graphical interface we build eventually becomes a liability -- something that must be maintained and improved over time, but with limited in-house frontend resources to do so.

## Partner Program

Abe and Nicolas are gearing up to build the next version of the partner site, and want to give partners the capability to generate "portfolios" composed of apps they've created on Heroku.

## Success Stories

== A natural progression for the addons architecture.

== Google and Mozilla are failing to monetize apps.


## Other Marketplaces



[Google Apps Marketplace (Enterprise)](https://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/?pli=1)

[Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/)  see [this embarrassing evidence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Tutorials/General/Profiting_from_your_app
) of their inability to monetize.

Furthermore, it aims to create a rich distributed ecosystem of HTML5 app stores, including a marketplace operated by Mozilla. Mozilla aims to put the developer back in control of every aspect of the app experience â€” from easy development to distribution to direct customer relationship management.

  What is an app? If you asked ten people, you'd probably get ten different answers.
  Some would say an app is something you pay 99 cents for on your iPhone; others might
  describe an app as a program your run on your computer; others might call websites apps.

  App stores are abundant:

  There's a plethora of device-centric app marketplaces out there:
  Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/from-the-app-store/">iOS</a> and
  <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/app-store.html">Mac</a> App Stores,
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store">Google Play</a> and the
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home">Chrome Web Store</a>,
  and now even Mozilla is in the game with the new
  <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/">Firefox Marketplace</a>.
