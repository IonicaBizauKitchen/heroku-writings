PVH asks...

> just curious what your thoughts on staffing a node initiative might look like. Is that a role you'd be interested in taking full time? Is it something you prefer to be a part-time contributor to? Do you have thoughts about who the right person might be either internally or externally?

## My Priorities

Things I'm working on now and intend to work on soon.

- [Ensou](https://github.com/heroku/ensou#readme), Heroku's Stylesheet Framework
- [Fuji](https://github.com/heroku/fuji), Heroku's cross-property navigation
- [Outlet](http://outlet.herokuapp.com/): CLI Plugin Productization
- [node-mirror](https://github.com/heroku/node-mirror) for a smaller, simpler, faster node buildpack.
- node/browser JavaScript client for v3 Platform API
- JavaScript CLI
- v3 Platform API Documentation
- Fixing Free
- Support for Static Sites

## Hard Stuff

Engineering problems that are important to our customers, yet beyond my areas of expertise. The Node project really needs someone with Unix skills.

- [caching](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/issues/17)
- [native/binary/compiled dependencies](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/pull/33)
- [clustering](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11410226/running-node-js-app-with-cluster-module-is-meaningless-in-heroku)
- [performance/scaling](http://arunoda.me/blog/how-to-monitor-dyno-usage-on-heroku-with-nodejs.html)
- [instrumentation](https://github.com/kennethreitz/bpwatch)
