As a product designer, I want to build, deploy, monetize, and distribute products with ease. Today Heroku takes me halfway there: I can build great apps and deploy them, but when it comes to monetizing and distributing my work, I'm on my own.

The Heroku Addons program is a great first implementation of this concept, but it's limited (perceptually) to Infrastructure as a Service providers. I want to extend the offering of  branding and distribution not just to Addons but to every app running on Heroku.

How can we create a workflow that gives app developers the power to brand their apps while maintaining the hacker DX that Heroku is known for? I think the answer is fewer web UIs, and more interfaces that give users flexibility and the freedom to use whatever tools fit their workflow. Furthermore, every graphical interface we build eventually becomes a liability -- something that must be maintained and improved over time, but with limited in-house frontend resources to do so.

I see some other reasons to push this forward:

Partner Program
Abe and Nicolas are gearing up to build the next version of the partner site, and want to give partners the capability to generate "portfolios" composed of apps they've created on Heroku.

Success Stories


== A natural progression for the addons architecture.

== Google and Mozilla are failing to monetize apps.
