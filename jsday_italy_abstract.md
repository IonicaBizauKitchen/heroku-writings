Talk Abstract for jsday.it 2013
===============================

May 15th-16th 2013 â€” Verona, Italy

Bio
---

I started writing ECMAScript as a freshman in college in 2000, when Flash 5 launched and Actionscript was really starting to become a powerful tool for self-expression. Since then I've worked as a designer and developer in a number of capacities. At Fractured Atlas, I built the Bay Area Cultural Asset Map [1], a Javascript-heavy mapping tool for arts advocacy and funding reform. In a recent job at Wornik, I created an open-source JSON-based API documentation framework called Swagger [2]. I recently built Queriac [3], a Rails app and Chrome extension that turns your address bar into a Javascript-powered command line. Today I'm a designer and hacker at Heroku, where I recently redesigned the Heroku Addons marketplace [4] and am working on a new app store. These days I write lots of Coffeescript, and am loving Node.js. I sometimes write about my exploits, Javascripty [5] and otherwise [6].

The Talk
--------

Small, Sharp Tools: Applying Unix design philosophy to Javascript development.

Working at Heroku has exposed me to some great ideas around writing small, useful software. In my talk I'll cover some of the techniques I use to maintain a productive and creative Javascript workflow.

- Objected-Oriented Thinking
- Opinionated Design
- State of the Selectors
- Dependencies, Schmependencies
- The Cake Pipeline

Notes
-----

I haven't spoken at many conferences, so I'm glad to see you're encouraging new speakers! I really look forward to giving this talk (and designing slides for it), and would love to visit Italy again!

Heroku would also be happy to sponsor your event, as we are in the process of expanding platform availability to Europe. What is entailed for bronze or silver sponsorship?

Thanks!
